🚰🔬 *Arduino-Based Water Quality Testing Device – Affordable Tech for Safer Water* 🔬🚰

Water quality directly affects public health, yet many households and rural communities still lack tools to assess it easily. Our project team — Sagar Kumar, Harshit Singh Khati  — proudly present our Arduino-Based Water Quality Testing Device designed to be low-cost, reliable, and beginner-friendly.

💡 Project Overview:
Our device uses an Arduino Uno, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensor, and a 16x2 LCD display to monitor water purity in real time. The TDS level is a key indicator of whether water is safe for consumption, and we display this data live using an intuitive interface.

⚙ How It Works – Simplified Flow:

1. The TDS sensor detects the concentration of dissolved solids in water by measuring its conductivity.
2. This analog signal is read by the Arduino Uno, which converts it to a digital value using its built-in ADC.
3. The microcontroller calculates the TDS in ppm (parts per million) using a calibrated formula.
4. The result is displayed on the LCD screen, showing whether the water is clean or unsafe based on the TDS threshold.
5. If the TDS value exceeds a certain limit (300 ppm), the device alerts the user instantly.

🔧 Key Features:

1. Real-time monitoring of water quality
2. Compact, portable, and affordable
3. LCD display for instant visibility
4. Automated feedback based on TDS levels
5. Can be extended with pH, turbidity, and IoT capabilities

🌍 Applications:
✅ Home tap water testing
✅ Rural and remote drinking water analysis
✅ Agriculture and aquaculture water checks
✅ Educational demonstrations
✅ Small-scale environmental monitoring

🔮 Future Enhancements:

* IoT integration with Wi-Fi for remote monitoring
* AI-based water quality prediction
* Solar-powered version for off-grid use
* Cloud data logging and mobile alerts

🎓 This project not only taught us practical embedded systems and sensor interfacing but also gave us insight into how technology can directly serve community well-being. We're grateful for the support of our mentors and proud to have built something impactful — as a team.
